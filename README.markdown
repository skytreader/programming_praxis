My implementations of stuff from Programming Praxis. Sorted by theme. When a problem is sorted into more than one theme, I only choose to include the source under one folder.

Each script was written to be ran inside its own directory. For example, to play
a game of hangman,

    programming_praxis$ cd games
    programming_praxis/games$ python3 hangman.py

In case that was still to subtle, all scripts here use `python3`
